# Project Inspiration

The idea behind Mobile Mart was born from our own similar  experiences shopping online. We’ve always admired the smooth and efficient processes of sites like Amazon and Apple Store, and we wanted to challenge ourselves to build something similar from scratch.

Our goal was to build a simple, modern interface where users could view products and make purchases with minimal friction. As software engineering students, this project allowed us to apply both front-end and back-end skills we’ve been developing, and it pushed us to step out of our comfort zone to work on new and complex aspects of e-commerce development.


# Technical Challenges

One of the toughest challenges in building Mobile Mart was designing the checkout cart. Ensuring it functioned smoothly required:

    1. Keeping track of item quantities.
    2. Managing pricing calculations in real-time.
    3. Handling updates when users added or removed items, all while ensuring data integrity across sessions.
